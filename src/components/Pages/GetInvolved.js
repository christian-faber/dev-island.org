          <p>
            Directly giving contributes to the careers and opportunities of
            potential students. While there are many other ways to contribute,
            this is a great way to show direct support for those around you
            aiming for better outcomes for themselves and their families. You're
            not just "teaching people to fish", you're also "providing them a
            pole".
