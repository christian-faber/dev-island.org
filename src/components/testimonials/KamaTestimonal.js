        Dev-Island has offered us the space to not only look at how we can
        improve our professional skills, but how we can improve ourselves. The
        community we've created has acted as a mirror for many of us. We've had
        no choice but to think about the 'why' in every aspect of our lives and
        that's a beautiful thing.
